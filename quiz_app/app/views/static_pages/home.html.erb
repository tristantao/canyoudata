            One situation where people slip into confusing correlation and causality is in regression. For example, one might regress college GPA on SAT scores, obtaining a positive coefficient beta of SAT score in the regression equation. Consider the following two statements:
        </p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <input id="q3_a" type="button" onclick = "getAnswer('3', 'a')" class="quiz_answer">
            A.   An increase of one point in SAT scores causes, on average, an increase of β points in college GPA.
        </input>
    </li>
    <li>
        <input id="q3_b"  type = "button" onclick = "getAnswer('3', 'b')" class="quiz_answer">
        B.   For every increase of one point in SAT scores, the increase in average college GPA is β points.
    </input>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="a3_box" class="answer_box">
    <p class="question_p">
        Statement B is correct (assuming, of course, that the regression has been carried out correctly). Statement A is incorrect: the regression equation gives no information about causality. Indeed, there is likely a lurking variable (or probably a bunch of lurking variables) that affects both GPA and SAT score; SAT score is considered to be a (perhaps crude) measure 1of this lurking variable.

            True/False: If there are only two possible outcomes, and you don't know which is true, the probability of each of these outcomes is 1/2.
        </p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <input id="q4_a" type="button" onclick = "getAnswer('4', 'a')" class="quiz_answer">  A)   TRUE </input>

        In fact, probabilities in such "binary outcome" situations could be anything from 0 to 1. For example, if the outcomes of interest are "has cancer" and "does not have cancer," the probabilities of having cancer are (in most cases) much less than 1/2. The empirical (frequentist) perspective allows us to estimate such probabilitie.
